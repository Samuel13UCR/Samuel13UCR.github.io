        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a second-year undergraduate at the University of California, Riverside, I am currently pursuing a major in Bioengineering with a deep passion for the intersection of biology, chemistry, and materials science. My academic journey so far has been shaped by curiosity, discipline, and a desire to understand both the intricacies of life on a cellular level and how engineering principles can be applied to improve human health. My coursework has spanned a wide variety of subjects, from foundational classes in general and organic chemistry, to advanced studies in physiology, mechanics, and material propertiesâ€”each building a strong, interdisciplinary base that supports my academic and research interests.

One of the most formative aspects of my undergraduate experience has been my involvement in heart valve research. Working in a lab that focuses on biomedical devices and cardiovascular engineering has provided me with hands-on experience in understanding how biological systems and synthetic materials interact. Whether through tissue culture work, computational modeling, or analyzing the structural integrity of valve materials, I have learned how to approach complex problems through both experimentation and theoretical frameworks. This research has not only sharpened my critical thinking and technical skills but also deepened my desire to contribute to the development of biocompatible materials and novel medical devices that can improve patient outcomes.<br><br>

       My interest in research extends far beyond academic requirements. I am genuinely driven by a desire to explore how the world worksâ€”especially the mechanisms that govern human biology and the possibilities of engineering solutions to unmet clinical needs. I often spend time outside of class reading scientific papers, learning new techniques, and expanding my knowledge in both biology and engineering. I take pride in being extremely detail-oriented, whether it involves fine-tuning data for analysis, optimizing lab protocols, or exploring new ideas in scientific literature. This attention to detail and commitment to continuous learning have been instrumental in helping me balance a rigorous academic schedule with extracurricular intellectual pursuits.

Looking forward, I am excited about expanding my research into more interdisciplinary areas such as biomaterials, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery systems. I am particularly interested in how materials can be engineered at the molecular level to mimic or integrate with biological tissues, as well as how micro- and nanoscale technologies can be harnessed to create smarter, more effective medical interventions.<br><br>

       

 I aim to pursue internships, collaborative projects, and further laboratory training that will allow me to explore these areas more deeply and contribute meaningfully to ongoing scientific work. I am also strongly considering pursuing a graduate degree in bioengineering or a related field, where I can continue to push the boundaries of what is possible at the interface of biology and engineering.

More broadly, I look forward to becoming part of a community of scientists, engineers, and clinicians who share a common goal of improving human health through innovation and research. I believe that meaningful scientific advancement requires not only technical excellence but also collaboration, communication, and empathy. As I continue my academic journey, I hope to engage with mentors, peers, and industry professionals who can challenge my thinking, inspire my creativity, and help me grow as both a scientist and a human being.

Ultimately, my goal is to use the skills and knowledge I am developing now to contribute to real-world solutionsâ€”whether itâ€™s creating a new type of heart valve material, optimizing a life-saving drug delivery system, or engineering next-generation biocompatible implants. With a strong foundation in the sciences and a passion for research and discovery, I am committed to shaping a future where engineering and biology work hand-in-hand to solve the worldâ€™s most pressing medical challenges
